1. Set a Schedule. 
First thing you can do is create a list of things you need to do.
This can be done using our TODO feature of the application, where you create a task and categorize it.

2. Study at your own pace and get some rest. 
Do you digest content quickly or do you need time to let the material sink in?
Find the right pace that suits you rather than trying to match someone else's speed.
Also, exhaustion helps no one perform their best. Your body needs rest. 
You can use our Timer feature to help you study in intervals and get rest in between for efficient study sessions.
Getting enough sleep is crucial for memory function as well.

3. Relax
Research shows that stress makes it harder to learn and to retain information. 

4. Pick a good place to study
Find your self a place that is comfortable without being so relaxing that you end up falling asleep.
Surrounding yourself with peace and quiet helps you focus.
